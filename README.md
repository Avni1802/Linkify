# Linkify - All your Links in one
## What is Linkify?
A site which lets you include all your links in a single page website with easy customizations. It gives you your own URL to share it with anyone you want on the internet.

## Highlights:
- Easily Customize the looks of your webpage based on your preference.
- Dashboard Interface with good UI.
- Have your own custom URL to your page.
- Open sourced and completely free. Community can keep adding new features and customize it since its open sourced.

## Why this project?:
- Everyone needs a website to quickly share which can have all their links together. Which is why an open sourced project can have more customizations and will be completely for free.
- Good project for the community to build as well as use it for themselves. Since making a project which is not much useful for the community is useless.
- Most of the other platforms have very limited customization and is paid feature.
